# Building and Running

1.  [Install the Haskell Stack build tool][stack]. Install on
    macOS/Linux/\*BSD if possible, as the Haskell toolchain has never been
    terribly reliable on Windows.

[stack]: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

2.  Install the compiler in a sandbox.

    Change directory to the project root, and run

     *  `stack setup`
